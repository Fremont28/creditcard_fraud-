Detecting cases of credit card fraud using an isolation forest algorithm 

Isolation forest algorithms are an effective way to detect anomalies (outliers) in datasets than more commonly used distance and density measures. The algorithm “isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.” 

In finance, isolation forests can be used to detect instances of credit card fraud. We used an isolation forest to detect credit card fraud using data from European credit holders in September 2013 over a two period (via Kaggle). Overall, the isolation forest correctly identified over 95% cases of credit card fraud.
